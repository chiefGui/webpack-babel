# webpack-babel

The simplest starter kit you've ever seen to run a Webpack and Babel application.

### Inspiration

There are lots of starter kits out there for your next front-end application.
But seriously, all that things were bullshit in my point of view: 90% of the
stuff packed you won't use; 5% were useless fancyness—just to say that the creator
is cool enough for using this or that tecnology; 4% were author's conventions and
_I think it could be useful for someone_-thing.

Facing this problem, I decided to create my own foundation without any framework,
tool or anything else integrated—this is by your own.

### Install

`git clone git@github.com:chiefGui/webpack-babel.git`

`npm install`

### Usage

`npm start`

_`/application/main.js` is your entry point. Use it!_

### Building for production
